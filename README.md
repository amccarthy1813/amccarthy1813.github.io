Personal resume page. I'm also using this to build my CSS, HTML, and Javascript skills.

### Notable parts
- Includes a print.css file so the page can be printed out with more compact styling.
- Resume.json file to seperate the web design from the content (making it easier to make changes to to the desgin and layout of the site).
